However, it has not blunted the risk Chinese EVs present to European automakers, which was demonstrated by the more than 100,000 job losses announced last year. The US–China trade war will add to these economic woes as European automakers are squeezed out of the Chinese EV market and could lose the US export market. Moreover, Chinese EV producers are opening plants in Spain, Hungary and the European neighbourhood to circumvent tariffs and divert trade. The Lower Saxony region in Germany, for example, cannot afford the loss of taxes from workers, corporate taxes and dividend payments from Volkswagen if it closes plants in the region. Nor can policymakers ignore the data security risks: under China’s National Intelligence Law, Chinese EV producers are legally required to work with the Ministry of State Security, and some European companies are advising their staff not to connect their phones or discuss their work in Chinese EVs. Chinese EVs are built on the basis of one-sided technology transfer. In the limited joint ventures in Europe where member states have increased local requirements, Chinese companies have cancelled projects. Alongside the presence of Communist Party cells in these companies, it is highly unlikely that Chinese EV producers will transfer technology to European automakers. Tariffs alone will not save the sector. Policymakers need to soberly assess the ‘red flags’ that Chinese EVs present and consider practical policy recommendations and ‘red lines’ to protect jobs and data security and create a European alternative. This includes a market share cap for Chinese EVs, the creation of a sovereign cloud storage system, and the creation of joint ventures with Japanese and Korean EV battery manufacturers.

This continued exploitation highlights a staggering analytical failure in Europe, where banking and finance are rarely seen as geopolitical domains. In March new US Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, acknowledged that 40%–50% of his role is national security. By contrast, how many of us can recall the last time a European finance minister discussed the centrality of money in our national security decision-making? Europe’s dependence on US-controlled financial systems demands urgent attention. In the eurozone, ‘banks’ accept demand deposits, offer credit and process payments, unlike credit institutions (credit-only) or payment providers (transactiononly). Large ‘direct participant’ banks access T21 for real-time settlements, while smaller ‘indirect participants’ rely on them, creating access dependencies. These regulated financial activities, deposit-taking being the most stringent of all, shape a system where most institutions outsource banking to cut costs, amplifying reliance on a few gatekeepers with direct access. This structure exacerbates vulnerability to dominance, a leverage the US has wielded for decades in pursuit of political ends. This policy brief analyses how US control over financial choke points undermines Europe’s strategic autonomy. It examines and reveals the frailty of assuming unfettered financial access will always be there. It explores how the US’s reach, coupled with banks’ risk-averse behaviour, restricts Europe’s policy options, threatening economic and national security ambitions. Without robust, indigenous financial alternatives, the continent risks being forced to bend to Trump. Finance continues to be a huge blind spot for economic security, receiving almost no attention from government officials more focused on which goods we buy and sell, but not how we pay for them. Europe must re-examine the status quo to understand the interplay between banks and non-banks. To counter this vulnerability, Europe must pursue strategic financial autonomy, defined as the condition whereby European actors can operate free from foreign coercion and sovereign entities can reliably implement policy through financial channels without external interference, a goal this brief advances through targeted recommendations. These include building a more resilient financial ecosystem, promoting euro-denominated liquidity and mitigating extraterritorial legal risks to ensure Europe’s policies are not subject to external vetoes or negation.

The 2021 partnership agreement on raw materials remains a valuable foundation. Still, in its current shape, it requires targeted enhancement to reflect the current geopolitical challenges and to more effectively integrate Ukraine into the EU’s critical raw materials strategy. By taking affirmative actions through targeted investment, active pursuit of joint ventures and technical support for Ukraine’s minerals sector, the EU can secure vital minerals for its automotive, defence, and aerospace industries. Simultaneously, these actions can support Ukraine’s recovery and accelerate its European integration. At the same time, Ukraine’s position is also crucial considering the strategic implications of the signed US-Ukraine minerals deal. The Ukrainian government must thoroughly manage how its new bilateral commitments influence its sovereignty, control over critical minerals, and ability to ensure regulatory and investment alignment with the EU. The key question is whether the Ukrainian government can balance partnerships with the EU and the US while maintaining its commitment to EU integration and legal obligations. In this regard, the EU should be more proactive, especially considering the importance that Ukraine’s critical minerals can play in meeting some of the CRMA objectives and its broader industrial resilience.

US President Trump has driven a wedge between US and European security, and is eroding NATO – to the delight of Vladimir Putin. However,si vis pacem, para bellum– this old adage is as true as ever. As the tectonic plates continue to shift beneath us, NATO needs to prepare for all eventualities. With the US becoming more transactional or even antagonistic, Europeans in NATO and the EU must change gear and focus on what is needed to become a serious geostrategic actor. The stakes could not be higher: If Europeans want to prevent the world form returning to an era where might makes right, they need to forge a shared vision of their future, including for defence and security. They need to find new leadership formulas, take a fresh look at institutional frameworks and laser-focus on building a broad range of capabilities. This policy paper outlines the strategic context, defines plausible scenarios, and then charts out key policy recommendations focusing on three main areas: leadership, enabling frameworks and structures, and key capabilities. Europeans in NATO and the EU can avoid a doomsday scenario where they would become the playball of strongmen in Washington, Moscow, or Peking. But that requires leadership, a firm belief in their strength, and determination to acquire the tools of an assertive geostrategic actor. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT? Download the publication",
https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/finlands-nato-strategy/,Finland’s NATO Strategy,10 June 2025,,"Finland applied for NATO membership on May 17, 2022 – less than three months after Russia started its war of aggression against Ukraine. The NATO countries signed the accession protocol on membership on July 5, 2022, when Finland became an observer member. Finland became a full member of NATO on April 4, 2023. The process was controlled, but fast. The long-standing political way of talking about Finland’s NATO option became history when both the citizens and the political leadership turned in support of NATO membership in a few weeks in the spring of 2022. At that time, Ajatuspaja Toivo and Wilfried Centre for European Studies published the collection of writings “Finland’s NATO Spring 2022”, recording the views of researchers and other experts on what membership would mean for Finland, how the process is progressing and what kind of historical change in our security policy is involved. Our publication produced new information to support political decision-making, which is our main task. Now, two years later, we return to the NATO topic. What should Finland consider in its NATO strategy? What is essential from the point of view of Swedish or Nordic cooperation? How are the security policies of the EU and NATO interrelated, and what is happening in the Arctic region? Conscript service and, of course, Russia’s perspective are also discussed in this work. The publication is a cross-section of the security situation, it takes part in the discussion about Finland’s role in NATO and it gives an opportunity to review and comment on the foreign and security policy reports that will be published later.

Based on comprehensive longitudinal Glocalities survey data from eight European countries, it reveals a growing divergence in values between young men and women, with young women increasingly embracing liberal and anti-patriarchal ideals, while young men lean towards traditional and conservative ideologies. This divergence poses a significant challengeto the conventional view of a uniformly progressive youth demographic. The study highlights the critical dimensions of hope versus despair and freedom versus control, which illuminate generational and gender-specific differences in (political) behavior. It uncovers a troubling trend of pessimism and societal dissatisfaction among young men aged 18–29, leading to decreased engagement, increased polarization, and the rise of right-wing populist movements. Young women have also been experiencing increasing despair, even more so than men. Economic and educational disparities further exacerbate these feelings, as structural changes in the global economy disproportionately impact young citizens, limiting job opportunities in traditional sectors. Despite these challenges, there is the potential for centrist parties to reclaim leadership by addressing generational divides, fostering inclusive narratives, and promoting trust in liberal democratic systems. By involving young people in substantive roles and by addressing their concerns, it is possible to reinforce European values and navigate the complexities of the future, while at the same time 1 acknowledging the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead.

From the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party has always seen space as key to cementing China’s status as a global superpower. These ambitions have outlived the Cold War era space race, with China’s State Council publishing five high-level policy papers on space between 2000 and 2021. Yet China’s space ambitions are about far more than building international status. Space capabilities are seen by China’s leadership as critical to economic security and military superiority, particularly as it seeks to control the strategic technologies of the future.

To access our Policy Director Peter Hefele’s contribution to this edited volume, titled “A Generation of Extremists? Values and Political Attitudes of European Youth”, clickhere. Democracy faces a range of threats today. The United States is gradually moving away from the liberal model towards authoritarianism, while Russia is actively seeking to weaken democratic institutions and strengthen its geopolitical influence. Russia’s strategy is aimed at systematically undermining transatlantic ties and marginalising US influence in Europe, which would allow it to strengthen its position and limit the influence of democratic forces. Democratic states in Europe have long underestimated, however, these risks and are often not prepared to respond adequately, leading to indecision and an inability to effectively counter new threats. Thus far, they have merely stood still. In addition to the traditional geopolitical risks, we also must address new challenges posed by the digital world. Social media platforms and other digital channels can be sources of democratisation of public space, but can also be used to spread disinformation and manipulate public opinion. Cyber- attacks, Internet silencing and online espionage are used by state and non-state bodies and require appropriate responses and strategies to defend democratic institutions. Against this backdrop, the nature of geopolitical competition between the European Union (EU) and Russia, in their shared neighbourhood, is changing. Both the EU and Russia seek to influence the political and economic direction of neighbouring states, but do so through fundamentally different approaches. The EU exerts the weight of its authority and calls for the promotion of democratisation, emphasising economic liberalisation, integration with European markets and the development of the rule of law in the process. In contrast, Russia relies on force and coercion, using increasing energy dependence, economic pressure and security threats to maintain influence.",
https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/strengthening-the-lgbtiq-voice-as-part-of-the-centre-right-narrative/,Strengthening the LGBTIQ+ Voice As Part of the Centre-Right Narrative,05 May 2025,,"For too long, the discourse on the rights of the LGBTIQ+ communities and individuals has been neglected in the political narrative and campaigning of conservative and Christian-democratic parties in Europe – leaving this space to be occupied by left-wing and green parties. Consequently, voting for EPP-affiliated political parties remained low in several countries. However, there is no reason for the EPP family to stay in this weak position. The core values of the EPP and its member parties are built upon respect for each individual and the unwavering demand for individual freedom, inclusion, and openness. Our objective is to keep building a society where each and every citizen can live freely and safely as individuals, as a part of a family and of society, and be respected for who they are. We strongly believe that these basic values endorsed by the political family of EPP are the strongest guarantee to ensure the rights of the LGBTIQ+ communities across Europe: freedom, respect, and the right for individuals to be different; but also to see and recognise the multitude of individuality, of which sexual orientation and gender identity are as important as other characteristics. In acknowledging and emphasising this fact, we reject the notion that being LGBTIQ+ is just some form of ideology. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT? Download the publication",

A popular rule of thumb holds that where the far-right attempts to legitimise people’s fear of immigrants and globalisation, mainstream parties should withstand the temptation to copy the far-right focus on immigration lest they strengthen the extremes and lose votes. Recent examples of national parliamentary elections in Europe show that the ‘copy-versus-the original’ thesis is false. The cases of Germany, Portugal, Poland, Greece and Denmark demonstrate that it is possible for the political mainstream to make immigration a rallying theme and win at the polls. In these countries, mainstream parties did ‘copy’ immigration as a campaign topic from the national populists or the far right. However, they did not reproduce the populist narratives in their entirety. Instead, these parties adopted tougher positions on immigration without the xenophobic undertones. On assuming power, they kept their countries firmly anchored to the framework of liberal democracy. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT? Download the publication See the publication in a flipbook",

The ruling Georgian Dream (GD) government has unilaterally decided to suspend EU accession talks until 2028 – despite the country having obtained EU candidate status in December 2023. This triggered mass unrest and raised serious concerns over Georgia’s democratic trajectory. Framed by GD as a move to protect national sovereignty from so-called undue external influence, the suspension is widely interpreted as a rejection of the EU’s reform conditions and a pivot away from democratic commitments and sliding back into the Russian sphere of influence. The decision has intensified domestic polarisation, with large swaths of the population viewing it as a betrayal of Georgia’s path to Europe. Protests have erupted nationwide, continuing for over 126 days. Demonstrators demand snap elections, increased accountability, and a recommitment to democratic norms. Over 500 individuals have been detained for participating in the protests. Among them, more than 50 have been charged with criminal offenses such as organising group violence, attacking police officers, and property damage. Several activists and journalists remain in custody under questionable charges. In parallel with suspending EU accession talks, the GD government has adopted a package of legislative measures without due public consultations, to further undermine democratic governance. These include a Foreign Agents Registration Act targeting civil society, restrictions on foreign funding for media that threaten independent journalism, and regressive amendments to gender equality laws. Further changes have politicised civil service appointments, weakened civil society’s structured role in participating in and monitoring policymaking, and introduced a controversial bill to ban political parties linked to the opposition. Together, these moves represent a clear drift toward authoritarian consolidation and a sharp departure from European democratic values. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT? Download the publication",

The EU needs an expanded trading playbook to meet the geopolitical moment. And while a strong transatlantic trading alliance will always remain central to the EU’s economic future, Brussels should not be purely reactive to policy shifts in Washington. Rather, the EU should develop flexible coalitions of trading economies, formed on an issue-by-issue basis. These coalitions—while anchored in trading relationships with Washington— should be conscious of the common challenges their members face due to the more transactional, and China-focused, US approach. As a first step, Brussels’s conception of the transatlantic alliance must be broadened into that of a trans-oceanic network, with an initial focus on Japan and South Korea. Both of these states and the EU face a US–China trade trilemma and all exhibit fundamental security dependencies on Washington. In this context, closer partnerships with Tokyo and Seoul will diversify EU trading risks and create a hedge against greater US conditionality. If developed in the context of US economic security and trading frameworks, these partnerships could also provide a common platform for navigating some of the US’s demands with regard to de-risking from China. Three principles are proposed. The first—compartmentalisation—refers to establishing mutually beneficial partnerships focused on sectoral issues, meaning partnerships which do not become distracted by the inevitable geopolitical disagreements in other areas. Several sectors are proposed for immediate further cooperation. The second—something new, something borrowed—holds that what is required is an evolution (and the extension) of existing agreements, rather than the creation of unnecessary new formats or institutions. The third principle is that these should be partnerships based on both pragmatism and politics, and therefore the extension of these agreements to like-minded partners should be a top priority. The UK should be the immediate focus, given London’s geopolitical links to Europe, the US and Asia. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT? Download the publication",

The energy ($11 billion), transportation ($34 billion), and housing and utilities ($56 billion) sectors were among those that experienced the heaviest damage, constituting nearly 75% of the total damage. Ukraine is projected to require $486 billion in recovery and reconstruction needs within a decade while considering economic factors like inflationary pressure and compliance with modern standards (e.g., low energy intensity). In this regard, the energy ($47 billion), housing ($80 billion), and transportation ($74 billion) sectors would require funding for nearly half of these recovery needs during this period. This report aims to understand Ukraine’s key reconstruction needs, the response to them, and potential ways the EU can contribute to Ukrainian recovery. It seeks to identify critical areas where the EU can focus its reconstruction efforts for the near-term and long-term perspective and potential benefits for Ukraine and the EU. This report also explores ways of enhancing collaboration between the Ukrainian government and the EU to speed up reconstruction efforts across Ukraine. It will touch upon the various funding instruments at the EU level and how to utilise them effectively to ensure transparent and sustainable support for the Ukrainian economic recovery.

It addresses the fragmentation of the European payment sector with the aim of highlighting ways to support the single market, strategic autonomy and the monetary sovereignty of the EU. Because the digital euro is a complex project requiring a thorough legal, economic and political assessment, this policy brief looks at three crucial aspects of the proposal. The brief first presents the essential features of the digital euro project in the context of European law, economics and politics. In contrast to private forms of electronic money that private banks create, the digital euro will be a retail central bank digital currency. As such, it will be a direct liability of the central bank, like cash. With many payments moving online, the digital euro ensures the role of public money in an increasingly digitised economy. This digital euro legislative framework should ensure trust by guaranteeing privacy, access to cash and financial inclusion. The establishment of a digital euro has the potential to cause structural changes to the banking system. Thus, it will need to have carefully calibrated holding limits and will not be remunerated—that is, like cash, interest rates will not be applied. Third, the policy brief identifies critical aspects, such as the distribution of competences between the lawmakers and the European Central Bank, that require thorough legal, economic and, ultimately, political assessment. Policymakers face difficult questions that ultimately relate to the European Central Bank’s exclusive competence over monetary policy, central bank independence and the relationship of these issues to the structure of the financial system. The brief concludes by offering a series of recommendations for policymakers. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?",

https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/the-7ds-digitalisation-extended/,The 7Ds – Digitalisation Extended,30 December 2024,,"Alongside the Green Deal and the first steps towards a Defence Union, creating a single European digital space was a key project of the outgoing European Commission (2019–24). This involved establishing an interconnected set of rules and regulations aimed at creating a level playing field for competition among European and international companies, enhancing the rights of Europe’s ‘digital citizens’, protecting the integrity of democratic institutions and processes, and promoting global cooperation in the digital sphere. Digitalisation is now seen as a key enabler that will lay the foundation for Europe’s future value creation. The success of this project will also determine the geopolitical weight of the Union vis-à-vis major competing powers such as the US and China. From a novel approach to artificial intelligence governance to a revamped understanding of competition law in the digital domain, the EU’s ambitions are high. Yet, piecemeal legislation and the lack of a fully integrated digital single market have led to inconsistent regulation, infrastructure gaps, a lack of investment and security-related issues in its digital sphere. Many European tech companies are struggling to offer their services outside national borders and to expand their reach to a genuinely European (and global) customer base. To survive in a world where the US and China and their digital giants dominate international competition, the EU needs not only up-to-date regulations that create a fair and level playing field and protect the interests of European citizens but also a strong industrial base. The EU must ensure the production and importation of next-generation semiconductors, joint European funding for breakthrough research and development, and access to secure global supply chains. These goals cannot remain aspirations but must be realised. The resilience of hardware infrastructure and software services throughout the EU is more than a mere technical concern: it impacts the security of sensitive user data, intellectual property rights and national security. At the same time, Europe needs a new culture of risk-taking and entrepreneurship to unleash the innovation potential of digitalisation in the fields of the green transformation and healthcare. Digitalisation is also helping to overcome regional disparities within Europe and is enabling new growth, particularly in the Central and Eastern European countries. The EU needs to boost its internal connectivity and digital excellence, and prepare for the ever-expanding global threats from hostile actors, malicious digital applications and state-led malign influence on online campaigns. When it comes to international partnerships, ‘coopetition’ will be the modus operandi of those countries that are part of the global democratic alliance.

https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/the-7ds-de-risking-globalisation-extended/,The 7Ds – De-risking Globalisation Extended,30 December 2024,,"Several crises over the last two decades, including the Covid-19 pandemic and, most recently, the Russian war against Ukraine, have shown the vulnerability of global supply-chain systems and have shattered illusions about ever-progressing globalisation. This has forced the EU to rethink its traditional reliance on and support for multilateralism and global cooperation, which had led to an over-dependence on certain countries and producers in crucial fields such as raw materials and chemical products. Over the last couple of years, the Union has responded to these developments by creating a series of policies and launching initiatives to de- risk its economic relations and reduce the potential for political blackmail. The biggest systemic competitor in this respect is China, due to its economic power, political governance system and global revisionist ambitions. The challenges posed by its unique politico-economic system require a comprehensive answer from all open and market-based societies in the West. Any de-risking strategy has to consider the effects on the sustainable transformation the EU is currently undergoing. Europe has always been a herald for open markets and globalisation. As it undergoes a massive transformation towards a low-emission economy, Europe should not build ‘green walls’ and engage in a subsidy race that may damage its long-term competitiveness. The success and flexibility of Europe’s economy lie largely in supporting flourishing ecosystems for small and medium-sized enterprises. Industrial policy can contribute to enhanced resilience but must avoid over- regulation and unilaterally favouring large companies. Shielding Europe’s economy and political system from external risks should not lead to abandoning the efforts to revitalise an open and sustainable global trade system. The priority should be to create alliances of the willing and promote the EU as a regulatory leader and reliable partner for third countries, particularly in the Global South. Strengthening the transatlantic trading relationship will continue to be a key element of this strategy.",
https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/the-7ds-demography-extended/,The 7Ds – Demography Extended,30 December 2024,,"The European welfare state is being challenged by new realities. People’s outlooks on life have changed dramatically over the past decades, including their views on religion, the family and work. The consequences of these societal changes include rising life expectancies and stagnating fertility rates that are insufficient for the natural increase of the population. Humanity’s efforts to curtail overpopulation and increase longevity have caused the ageing of our societies, a trend that has been under way for decades. Our institutions and policies are not ready for these developments. National social security systems lack sustainable funding. Labour market rules are lagging behind the needs of the ageing societies, and these rules do not capitalise on the experience that older workers can bring in. In general, pronatalist policies in the form of cash transfers to young families have not fulfilled their objective. The EU’s population has been growing only thanks to immigration from outside the bloc, but family reunification—the most frequent type of EU-bound immigration—has not improved the ratios of workers to non-workers. In Southern and Eastern Europe and in many regions elsewhere on the continent, depopulation and emigration are compounding the problems caused by ageing. Moreover, the Covid-19 pandemic has contributed to a worsening of mental health. This has impacted young people with particular severity, keeping them out of schools and jobs. To mitigate the effects of population ageing and the other phenomena mentioned, it is incumbent on the EU’s national governments to create institutional environments that increase human capital and make it easier for women and men to both pursue a career and raise a family. As for the numbers of children born, the fact that fertility rates in some EU countries are higher than in others suggests the crucial importance of national social policies. It used be assumed that a woman who ‘stays at home’ is more likely to have children than a woman who ‘pursues a career.’ Contrary to that outdated notion, it now appears that having stable work allows those who wish to have children to choose to do so. Health care, affordable housing and lifelong learning have become crucial for maintaining the well-being of the population and a productive labour force. The participation of women, older people, young people and immigrant groups in the labour market must be increased. The state pension age should be increased, albeit with elements of flexibility to allow for individual choice. Finally, innovative solutions are needed to address both depopulation in some countries and areas and the growing regional imbalances within the EU. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?",

Since the first direct election of the European Parliament in 1979, the EU’s democratic system has developed hugely too: by increasing transparency, empowering the European Parliament, making the European Commission more accountable and even involving citizens in innovative experiments such as the Conference on the Future of Europe. As a result, the EU now has clear dual democratic legitimacy as a union of states and citizens, each represented in one of the equal co-legislators: the Council and the European Parliament respectively. Moreover, the multilevel nature of EU democracy is recognised through the direct involvement of the national parliaments in various capacities, from the ratification of mixed trade agreements to the yellow and orange card procedures which protect subsidiarity. As a side effect of the last 15 years of successive crises, EU affairs have also become more politicised. As a result, European issues have become essential to national democratic debates, and a European public sphere has finally begun to emerge. It is important that democratic accountability does not lag behind political and institutional developments, as has at times been the case over the last decades when new rules and bodies have been created outside the EU legal framework to react to crisis situations. As the EU acquires new powers and competences to manage new challenges in the most diverse fields, it will be necessary to improve the quality of EU democracy, the legitimacy of its institutions, and their responsiveness to the needs and preferences of the EU member states and citizens. Moreover, democratic values and institutions face new challenges, such as disinformation, polarisation and a lack of trust in political elites—all in a world of systemic rivalry.

https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/the-7ds-decarbonisation-extended/,The 7Ds – Decarbonisation Extended,30 December 2024,,"With its 2019 Green Deal and the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, the EU aims to become the most influential global actor when it comes to advancing the international agenda on decarbonisation and the fight against climate change. Geopolitical conflicts have increasingly shifted political priorities and resources, making the commitments pledged in the previous decade even more challenging to achieve. At the same time, resilience and economic security have become key criteria for the future transformation. Through its domestic and external relationships, the EU has to be able to ensure a sufficient and reliable supply of materials, fuels, technologies and skills, while meeting the energy demand of its citizens and industries in a secure, flexible and efficient manner. The benefits of the transformation project must be balanced with the need for social acceptance. Openness towards manifold innovation patterns is as important as political and regulatory predictability. Given the gigantic financial resources needed to transform the existing fossil-based economies, the role of the private sector is crucial to making this happen faster and in a more cost-efficient manner. The volume of private investment in technology and infrastructure must be scaled up massively, as public sources will be less available due to the already high levels of debt. Due to the the existing regulatory framework, financial instruments are still not sufficiently accessible for a large part of the corporate sector. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) lack access to bond market investors and various sophisticated products. For too long, issues linked to the green transition have been separated from those related to the security of raw materials. But this ignores the ways in which both kinds of issues are inextricably bound up with each. This is because some of these raw materials are components essential to digitalisation, and the green transition and digitalisation are inseparably linked with each other. Ensuring a stable and affordable raw material supply chain without getting into new import dependencies, with all their geopolitical implications, requires a strategic reorientation of European politics. The EU has to regain lost ground in the design and production of innovative clean technology. Most of the progress in this area is being made in North America and Asia, and it is there that most large-scale production is also taking place. State subsidies have distorted the level playing field and given rise to daunting challenges for European companies.",
https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/the-7ds-debt-extended/,The 7Ds – Debt Extended,30 December 2024,,"Debt is a question of dose. Too much, and you lose your political independence and sovereignty. Too little, and you might miss out on the possibility and necessity of building infrastructure that facilitates future development. Keynes taught us that there are situations in which price and interest signals do not work and, as a result, the state is the only actor able to step in temporarily and stabilise the economy—and with it, the political system. A hard lesson was learned in the 1930s. It inspired us during Covid, when the economy threatened to come to a standstill. But debt was put on the EU’s balance sheet without corresponding own resources for the Union to finance and repay it. In addition, no proper parliamentary oversight of debt at the EU level was introduced. Unfortunately, we have now entered a period of vulgar Keynesianism: increasing the debt-to-GDP ratio in crisis times and in good times as well. The consequence is a debt-to-GDP ratio of about 90% in the eurozone and around 100% in the UK and the US. If this trend continues, it will not be very long before a debt crisis reoccurs and the independence of our political decision-making is threatened, together with the cohesion of the EU. China and Japan are no exception to this trend. Japan has already demonstrated how ageing societies, with correspondingly meagre growth, can enter into decades of exploding debt. China’s debt is largely out of control, especially on the local and regional level, for which the central state will ultimately have to take responsibility. This accumulation of debt was partially driven by the end of a property building boom and significant over-capacity in many sectors of the economy. This has resulted in Chinese debt levels no longer being accompanied by a sustainable growth model. The situation is further aggravated by the fact that public investments have become unavoidable in digital infrastructure, defence and decarbonisation, and to alleviate the financial burdens of unfavourable demographics. De-risking from China will add to the burden. The time of imported deflation that was the consequence of hundreds of millions of Chinese workers being integrated into the global market for the first time seems to be over.",

And indeed, because money is at the centre of everything, it also plays a crucial part in politics – even though it might sound provocative, democracy also has a dollar—or, in this case, a euro—figure attached to it. To put it simply, democracy needs money to function. And because the money is always elsewhere than in politics, politicians need to make an effort to reach out to gain access to it. However, in democracies this needs to be done transparently (and efficiently) so that the flows of money towards parties and politicians do not interfere with the will of the people. This publication explores the many ways in which money and politics interact, and provides a roadmap for political parties to act for a more transparent and effective financing of European politics: from state subsidies to private fundraising, from regulation to oversight institutions, from protecting European politics from the influence of foreign authoritarian actors to funding European political parties, the authors provide an in-depth analysis of the tools that politicians have to better fund politics in Europe.

This is not just a workforce issue—it is a threat to the very fabric of Europe’s future. As populations dwindle, particularly in peripheral regions, the labour deficit grows more alarming by the day. Drawing on best practices and informed by the current political and socio- economic landscape, this policy brief argues that attracting young global talent, particularly through education, is no longer a choice but a necessity to combat depopulation and ignite economic revival. This policy brief sets forth urgent recommendations which include establishing clear migration targets, strengthening reskilling and civic–linguistic training programmes for migrants, fully digitising migration-management processes and fostering cooperation with source countries. Together, these measures should aim to build a compelling ‘European Dream’, attracting and retaining the skilled individuals essential for the continent’s future prosperity. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?

To read the long version, clickhere. The European Union is at a crossroads, both in terms of its internal constitutional reform and the integration of new member states. Hence, deepening and enlargement are inseparably linked together. Finding solutions to both challenges will be the major task of the new legislative term of the European Parliament and Commission from 2024 to 2029. As the official think tank of the European People’s Party (EPP), the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies develops policy options for European decisionmakers and opinion leaders from a centre-right perspective. Having been the driving force behind past European integration and enlargement processes since the creation of the European Economic Community in 1957, the political family of the EPP feels a distinct obligation to shape the decisive next steps and lay a successful path ahead for a next-generation European Union. While the last major round of new EU memberships in 2004 happened under comparatively stable regional and geopolitical circumstances, the current situation couldn’t be worse. Russia’s war against Ukraine, the Middle East again on the brink of a regional conflict, and an assertively rising China are only three major destabilising and adverse developments working against the core ideas of Europe as an anchor of peace, stability, and well-being. Enlarging the European Union to gain more weight as a geopolitical actor and stabilise the endangered periphery by integrating neighbouring nations into the framework of the European Union is often mentioned as an argument in favour of opening “the club” to new members. At the same time, the rise of Eurosceptic parties shows a growing discontent with the Union’s current functioning and is blurring the prospect of an accelerated and successful enlargement process. In the context of the European Election 2024 and the constitution of a New European Commission under Ursula von der Leyen, the Martens Centre commissioned Leuven-based Ipsos to conduct a data-driven survey across all EU-27 member states. To better understand EU citizens’ attitudes and their views towards the enlargement and deepening of the European Union, the research project looked more closely at the following dimensions:",

The prevailing scientific consensus is that humankind is directly responsible for most of the rising carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere and their related negative effects. Within the EU political mainstream, these findings have positively resonated in policy and resulted in the most ambitious climate agenda globally. Most European citizens also recognise the threats of climate change and the need for our society to adapt and move in a more sustainable direction. Decarbonisation is one of the most important political challenges of this century. The goals that have been set for European carbon neutrality by 2050 are laudable but presuppose the mobilisation of huge financial and material resources, as well as fundamental changes in the economic, industrial, transport, agricultural and energy sectors of European states. Climate spending already dominates the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the post-Covid recovery fund, with hundreds of billions of euros earmarked for the transition. The European Green Deal has a direct bearing on the economic performance of member states and private enterprises, while also becoming ever more present in the lives and pockets of European citizens. Importantly, the clean energy transition has a direct impact on the EU’s competitiveness and geopolitical clout. Consider the complexity of implementing such a transformative effort in concert with the rest of the international actors, which have all the incentives to free-ride on the efforts of others or delay the transition away from fossil fuels as long as possible. The decarbonisation destination is set, but the policy routes are many and uncertain. Regrettably, the EU is in a completely different financial and geopolitical position compared to 2019, when the European Green Deal was announced. We already see clear signals that the current framework is neither generating ‘green growth’ nor putting the continent on a fast track towards carbon neutrality. If the EU is serious about its decarbonisation pledges, it needs to rethink its approach. This paper has two main objectives. First, it briefly addresses the main shortcomings of the Green Deal—the economic costs of the transition and the effect on European energy security and resource scarcity. It also looks into the overly optimistic projections for the renewable energy rollout and the huge investment gap in decarbonisation. More importantly, it puts forward a number of policy recommendations for European policymakers in the new legislative period. Achieving carbon neutrality should remain the long-term goal, but the policy arsenal has to be improved. The European centre–right needs to be actively involved in leading this strategy by crafting a blueprint that is both realistic and achievable and that is shaped by its own vision and political values.",
https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/why-europe-needs-a-nuclear-deterrent-a-critical-appraisal/,Why Europe Needs a Nuclear Deterrent: A Critical Appraisal,01 October 2024,,"Nuclear weapons remain the unquestioned core of European defence and security policy. Most European countries rely on NATO’s nuclear umbrella for collective defence, primarily under US leadership, while a few, such as France, continue to address nuclear issues on a strictly national basis. The current security landscape in Europe is characterised by growing complexity and uncertainty. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has highlighted Europe’s security vulnerabilities and raised concerns about Moscow’s nuclear sabre-rattling, especially in the Black Sea region. Furthermore, the emergence of revisionist powers, such as Russia and China, which are challenging the Western-led liberal world order, presents a new two-peer challenge for Euro-Atlantic security and NATO’s extended nuclear deterrence. This, combined with the evolving dynamics of American foreign policy in the Indo-Pacific region and the potential re-election of the ‘transactionalist’ Donald Trump in November 2024, highlights the imperative for a critical reassessment of the role of nuclear weapons in Europe. In this context, a rigorous political debate is essential to explore the potential need for a common European nuclear deterrent, while prioritising the preservation of both the Atlantic Alliance and the Non-Proliferation Treaty regime. This research paper aims to critically evaluate the viability and necessity of implementing a shared nuclear deterrent for Europe, thereby enhancing the continent’s autonomy in its collective security and defence policy decisions. Taking into consideration Europe’s historical context and the current state of nuclear deterrence, the paper meticulously examines the prospects and challenges of establishing such a deterrent. It presents potential avenues and policy recommendations. Ultimately, the paper seeks to provide valuable insights that contribute to the academic and political discourse, and a compelling argument for EU policymakers to reconsider, discuss and potentially establish a European nuclear deterrent.

Despite some promising joint initiatives, including the establishment of the EU–US Technology and Trade Council and the Minerals Security Partnership, the US and the EU have taken divergent approaches to managing economic security risks. This divergence is particularly noticeable in how they deal with subsidies, supply chain diversification, tariffs and investment restrictions. This policy brief identifies several areas in which the next European Commission and European Parliament should deepen transatlantic cooperation and deal with the shared economic security challenge presented by the PRC. The brief puts forward a set of policy recommendations which include coordinating strategic investments in green technology production, expanding joint dialogues, creating shared standards on issues such as data security, reviewing the case for a ‘Buy European’ requirement for access to EU subsidies and a range of special measures to protect the EU’s automotive industry.

This should include inviting the British people into plans for Europe’s future: with war in Europe having been inflicted by Putin, this is not transactional cherry-picking, but must instead be seen by Europe’s political leadership as a strategic imperative. The recent bilateral concord between France and the UK is a positive precedent. This paper illustrates three priority areas where greater UK–EU cooperation could take place: in environmental policy, in forming a European capital market and in defence. In addition, four further elements of civil society are viewed as being essential to tangibly reconnect the British with the heart of Europe on a practical level. These are reciprocal youth mobility (including British membership of Erasmus+), the re-engagement of civic interest groups, the UK rejoining Creative Europe, and the reinvigoration of town and city twinning initiatives. In the aftermath of the recent elections, a unique opportunity now exists for the UK and the EU to work together for their common benefit. Strengthening the European identity through public policies will empower more of Europe’s citizens to share more of life’s experiences, grounded in a mutual commitment to democracy and the rule of law.

It was a hubristic vision that ignored the complex interdependencies of contemporary globality that constrain national agency, especially for smaller and medium-sized states. The protracted withdrawal negotiations that followed the 2016 Brexit referendum exposed these fallacies. Amongst the most critical of the unanticipated consequences of the ‘hard Brexit’ pursued by the British government was the impact on the border arrangements and management of the island of Ireland, the only place where the EU and its former member state share a land frontier. It is a problematic border because it is fraught with historical memories, Moreover, this conflict was only relatively recently pacified by the Belfast Agreement (1998), of which the EU acted as a major guarantor. The signing of this agreement led to a historic but nevertheless fragile peace, brokered between the two culturally entrenched communities in Northern Ireland. In these circumstances, what Brexiteers had confidently predicted as a straightforward withdrawal turned out to be anything but, because Brexit threatened to destabilise the peace process. This paper examines the role the Irish border issue played in the fraught withdrawal process: that is, its consequences both for the Brexit that eventually transpired and for the peace process, and no less significantly, for the future relations between the UK its erstwhile EU partners.

First, it traces the evolution of the two faces of intra-parliamentary relations in the European Parliament since its early days: cooperative and adversarial politics. Cooperation between the ‘core’ groups of the Socialists, Liberals and Christian Democrats has been the dominant guiding principle. The historical analysis explains why the European Parliament follows a different logic than most national parliaments and illustrates how this cooperation has played out. The continued existence and relevance of the parliamentary core is demonstrated next. Despite a decline in the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and EPP groups’ seat shares. the core has persisted and remained relevant. The analysis of data obtained by calculating two indices, the institutional relevance index and a newly developed political relevance index, demonstrates that, even if the core has shrunk, it has maintained a dominant role in the European Parliament. The prospects for the core groups in the tenth term are then considered. Although the EPP would be well-placed to look for new partners and alliances on its own terms, the analysis suggests that embarking on such a course would be fraught with difficulty. The analysis of intra-group cohesion and intergroup agreement data found in the literature highlights the considerable difficulties that The EPP would encounter in pursuing anything more than sporadic cooperation on selected issues with other groups. Even without the S&D group, the EPP’s need to rely on Renew makes durable coalitions with groups such as the European Conservatives and Reformists or Identity and Democracy unlikely because of Renew’s low levels of agreement with these groups. It is likely that the European Parliament’s incoming term will witness a continuity in intergroup relations. Therefore, the advantages of more conflictual relations between the core groups are limited, and cooperation can be expected to prevail. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?",

Fierce competition, the transformation of the economic interdependencies into a weapon, the return of conflict to the European continent, are only some of the global challenges that require solutions. The new institutional cycle in the European Union begins in this complex environment. What are the main tasks, how to meet the challenges, what are the dilemmas that need to be resolved? The answers to this questions are not unequivocal. However, it is obvious that there is a growing need for greater coherence and coordination in solving complex problems. The analysis of the dilemmas that the European Union has to resolve lead to several key themes: first, how to achieve and guarantee economic security without succumbing to the temptation of protectionism; second, how to achieve a balance between the ambitious goals of the green transition and the need to increase the competitiveness of the European economy; thirdly, how to combine the geopolitical imperative to support the candidate countries and their EU membership with the requirements for strict implementation of the criteria, as well and with the real preparation of the European Union to accept new members; and last but not least how to combine the need for huge investments for the green and digital transition and at the same time to observe financial discipline.

Who has arrived here over the past 10 years? And to what extent have these migrants integrated? This paper provides answers based on the data on foreign-born residents, first residence permit data, statistics on first asylum requests and information on temporary protection for Ukrainians. It includes a number of novel data breakdowns. The main finding is that over the past 10 years, about 50% of all people immigrating to the EU have been admitted for humanitarian reasons. Some 27% arrived as marriage migrants or for family reunion purposes. The number of those admitted for employment was just 17%. Notably, a third of all immigrants coming to the EU during the past 10 years arrived in 2022. The paper shows that labour market outcomes depend to some extent on the structure of migration flows. Mobile EU citizens usually move for reasons of employment. Third-country nationals residing in the EU have much lower employment rates and a significantly higher risk of working below their skill level. Those third-country nationals admitted as refugees, for family reunion reasons or as marriage migrants are less likely to integrate into EU labour markets. This is particularly true for female migrants. Throughout the EU, native workforces are shrinking. Migrants can only compensate for the emerging gaps if their talents and skills are compatible with Europe’s needs. This necessitates the admission of non-EU migrants based on their skills acquired abroad and a rapid recognition of these skills, or the massive retraining of migrants who do not meet the necessary criteria. In any case, European societies will have to put more emphasis on the integration of migrants and their EU-born children. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?",

This makes the digital platform an extremely powerful media tool, able to have a huge impact on socio-economic and political relationships, including elections, and on the questioning of fundamental principles, such as democracy. Digital platforms have already been used several times to manipulate elections. Such platforms operate with significantly less regulation than traditional media, which have historically been subject to stricter oversight to ensure the accuracy and reliability of information. This disparity in regulatory standards underscores the importance of developing and implementing more robust regulatory frameworks for digital platforms in order to mitigate the spread of disinformation and protect the integrity of public discourse. Rigorous regulation of online media and Internet platforms is needed, as well as the continual raising of public awareness of disinformation. This policy brief has three main objectives: (1) to analyse the existing components of the EU’s strategy to combat disinformation, particularly the Digital Services Act, which provides the legal framework for digital services, and the Code of Practice on Disinformation; (2) to identify the key limitations and challenges of the current regulations; and (3) to develop policy recommendations and measures to overcome these limitations and address the threat of disinformation in upcoming elections. The brief emphasises the urgency of implementing the developed policy recommendations and measures before upcoming elections and the need for a comprehensive, multi-stakeholder approach to safeguard the integrity of democratic processes, prevent the spread of disinformation, and ensure fair and transparent elections across the EU.

https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/explaining-the-rise-of-the-radical-right-in-europe/,Explaining the Rise of the Radical Right in Europe,13 June 2024,,"Over the past few decades, the radical right has been the most researched political family in Europe. Consequently, a significant amount of literature has been produced that explores the conceptual, theoretical and empirical dimensions underlying the rise of these political parties. This review article aims to assess the current trends, debates and level of understanding in the academic literature by examining three key questions. What are radical-right parties? How can their electoral successes be explained? What are the consequences of their rise for national and European politics? Although terminology and definitions may differ, radical-right ideology consistently includes authoritarianism, nationalism and opposition to liberal democracy. While their economic positions may be quite diverse, they find common ground on issues such as immigration and tradition. Explanations for the rise of the radical right focus on what attracts voters (demand-side explanations) and on how the parties themselves creatively use the political opportunity structures to gain influence (supply-side explanations). Relations between the radical right and the mainstream parties, as well as the strategies used to counter competitors, have substantial effects on the nature of party competition.

All rights reserved with the Politische Akademie Wien. Complaints about the decline of political parties are part of the everyday political wisdom of Western democracies. If this were indeed true, it would threaten the existence of parliamentary democracies. To this day, parties are its most important political actors. A closer look, however, shows that, despite all the dramatic changes in modern Western societies, the importance of political parties remains undiminished and that no convincing alternatives have yet developed that could take over central functions of parties, such as elite recruitment or program development. Nevertheless, the need for adaptation and modernisation of party organisations remains. The comparatively young European Political Parties play a unique role. As party parties, they sometimes differ significantly from national parties. However, they play a central role in strengthening democracy at the European level and in the democratisation of new member states. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?

https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/coming-out-of-the-shadows-the-european-stability-mechanism-and-euro-area-governance/,Coming out of the Shadows: The European Stability Mechanism and Euro Area Governance,30 May 2024,,"The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is well suited to having a larger role in the euro area governance framework. During the euro-area debt crisis, financial pressures were eased by ESM loans and many reforms were implemented that targeted former policy mistakes. However, the ESM’s public image is tainted due to a political debate that is (unduly) critical of the fact that financial support is conditional on the implementation of reforms. Currently, the ESM lacks the instruments to support countries with relatively sound economic policy fundamentals. But, an ESM instrument appropriate to this type of support is to be created with an envisaged ESM reform. The reform would introduce a changed precautionary credit line (PCCL). This would provide general access to an ESM loan without the respective country necessarily drawing on it. Such a precaution would be intended to calm the financial markets should they begin to doubt the debt sustainability of a country. The new PCCL would not entail reform prescriptions by the ESM (ex postconditionality) but would require sound economic policy fundamentals as a precondition (ex anteconditionality). Choosing to use the ESM is a better way to tackle the current challenges than relying on the European Central Bank with its overly lax Transmission Protection Instrument, as appears to be the current choice. While this instrument might calm financial markets for some time, its overly generous application would reduce incentives for sound economic policy. On top of this, lax reform of the Stability and Growth Pact could also carry the danger that public debts rise further. In the end, this could result in the economic situation deteriorating in a dangerous way. With economic policies diverging widely from the course the euro area governance framework provides for, letting the European Central Bank intervene in the financial markets would be increasingly difficult to justify legally. In this case, the danger of a sovereign default and of an escalating financial crisis in highly indebted countries could loom. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT? Download the publication",

Yet, there is hardly any public debate about the effectiveness, or even political legitimacy, of this policy field. The competition with ‘new’ donors such as China and India has raised fundamental questions about whether the concept of development as it has been pursued over the last 60 years, should undergo a complete revision and whether the traditional understanding of development itself needs to be abandoned. This brief develops a new conceptual framework from a centre–right perspective to critically review current policies and suggest new approaches. If the established system continues, we will see a further delegitimisation of this important field of international cooperation and a reduction in the global influence of the EU.

This marked a year since the EP adopted its first stand-alone report on EU-Taiwan political relations and cooperation, raising key European concerns about the situation in the Taiwan Strait, including security, peace and stability, and threats to the rules-based international order. The resolution urged the bloc to intensify bilateral relations and “pursue a comprehensive and enhanced partnership under the guidance of the EU’s One China Policy”. These developments capture thenew reality in EU-Taiwan relations, marked by an unprecedented level of European awareness of Taiwan’s strategic relevance to the bloc’s interests, seen in the context of efforts to rebalance relationswithChina. With the central balance of international power shifting from the Euro-Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific, and with the US-China rivalry intensifying, Taiwan’s relevance has recently increased. In light of China’s support for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, Taiwan’s importance as a frontline democracy has also grown. Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s warning “Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow”, was a sign that regional states in the Indo-Pacific are reassessing their defence positions.

Its three rescue packages, organised initially by the European Commission, European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) sparked an unprecedented decade of economic and political turbulence. The austerity (and declining living standards) associated with the bailout period came to define the structural flaws of the Euro currency. For a time in the mid-2010s, Greece’s survival in the Euro was irrevocably entwined with political events in both Brussels and Berlin. Yet, throughout this period Greek public support for both EU and Eurozone membership remained high. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, Greece’s debt to GDP ratio was pushed to a historic high of 207%, higher even than during the bailout crises of the preceding decade. However, the past four years have seen a remarkable transformation of Greece’s long term debt sustainability. As of Quarter 3, 2023 Greece’s debt stood at 165% of GDP – a decline of over 42 percentage points, or over a fifth – in just three years. Longer-term projections indicate that debt to GDP levels will continue to fall and may achieve a lower level than Italy and France by the end of the decade. In 2023, Greece – for the first time since 2010 – reattained investment grade status from three of the four biggest ratings agencies. Latest forecasts indicate continued strong debt reduction driven by moderate growth and sustained primary budget surpluses. Debt to GDP levels are likely to fall under 150% in late 2024/early 2025. Despite continued structural challenges – low productivity, demographic profile and increasing environmental risks – Greece is still projected to outperform its Euro Area peers in the medium to long term.

We continue to analyse the nuanced effects of Western sanctions against Russia two years since the beginning of Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and, in contrast to the widespread international optimistic assessment of “Russia’s economic resilience” to sanctions, paint a very different picture: behind the facade of a handful of positive macroeconomic indicators like strong GDP growth and low unemployment, Russia’s actual economic reality is much bleaker, and the situation is getting worse. This paper intends to provide Western policymakers with realistic in-depth analysis of multiple effects of sanctions on the Russian economy, helping to identify areas where sanctions are truly working, and Putin’s main economic vulnerabilities, an un-derstanding of which is crucial to further strengthening the Western response to Putin’s war of aggression against Ukraine, and limiting Russia’s ability to finance the war.

Changes in Religiosity and Values Among Natives and Migrants in Europe,27 March 2024,,"This study provides an assessment of the disparities in secularisation between the migrant and native populations in the EU. Although religion is a force that continues to shape societal culture, secularisation—the progressive autonomisation of societal sectors from religious meaning and institutions—is gaining strength across the bloc. The study, which relies on scholarly works and quantitative data from survey institutes, explores variations across different member countries and societal groups. It finds that north-western, mainly Protestant, EU countries are the most secularised, while eastern, mainly Orthodox, ones exhibit higher levels of religiosity and more conservative values. Overall across the EU, immigrant populations exhibit higher levels of religiosity and conservatism compared to native populations. Muslims prove more resistant than any other religious group to secularisation and acculturation processes, even across generations. Ukrainian nationals manifest a unique pattern of increased religiosity alongside increased acceptance of secular values. The study advocates for policies that promote secularism and socio-cultural assimilation in order to foster societal cohesion while celebrating diversity. The centre–right in the EU should work towards a common framework of secularism, while respecting national differences. It should balance the legal and moral duties towards immigrants on the one hand, and the protection of state law and respect for individual rights on the other hand. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?

The main aim of the research is to achieve a better understanding of factors determining the changing attitudes toward the European Union (and its institution) among the ethnic Hungarian population in Romania. The current analysis aims to present an overall view of the attitudes of Hungarians inTransylvania towards the EU and about its changes between 2014, 2019 and 2023. Romania joined the EU in 2007. The Hungarian community within Romania has a particular attitude towards the EU and has specific expectations from it. This analysis deals mainly with these attitudes and expectations. According to the census in 2021, there are about one million ethnic Hungarians in Romania representing 6 percent of the country’s permanent population. In the European Parliament elections, the Hungarian community in Transylvania has elected two deputies: in 2007, the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (RMDSZ) won two seats and one independent candidate; in 2009 the RMDSZ won three seats and in 2014 and 2019 sent two members of the EP in Brussels. The report is based on three surveys carried out on a representative sample of Hungarian population in Transylvania, Romania. The surveys used a similar methodology (same sampling methodology, same questions) to elicit opinions expressed by ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania. The research aimed to compare the opinions of Hungarians in Transylvania with the population of Romania and other member states. The three main reference points for interpreting attitudes were the EU averages, the data for Romania and for Hungary, respectively. The main subject areas of our analysis are the following, among others: general social climate, main challenges for the population, general direction of the EU (geopolitical context), trust in the EU, opinions about accession to the EU, its benefits and disadvantages.

In 2021, they launched the EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC), promising to boost bilateral trade and strengthen cooperation on pressing technological challenges. since the TTC was launched with fanfare in Pittsburgh, the forum has helped foster the revival of transatlantic purpose, first by combatting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and second by agreeing on the need to “derisk” rather than “decouple” from China. Entering 2024, however, challenges are mounting. The two sides are sparring over clean technology subsidies and moving at different speeds on tech regulation. Europe pursues a “digital sovereignty” agenda that discriminates against leading US tech companies. The US invests in a new industrial policy, offering billions of subsidies to bring home high-tech manufacturing. Elections scheduled before the year-end on both sides of the Atlantic could prove divisive, particularly if isolationist leaders come to power in Washington. The TTC can help reduce the risks — if reformed and strengthened. The forum must be streamlined and tasked with a few realistic yet ambitious goals. It should engage a broad range of stakeholders, with the participation of the European Parliament, the US Congress, and high-level business leaders. On substance, the TTC must align the two powers on tough issues, not shy away from disagreement. It represents an ideal platform to forge a common position on how to “derisk” from China, create a new transatlantic green tech alliance that limits domestic subsidies to clean technologies, and construct a common semiconductor supply chain. Despite their divergent domestic approaches to regulating artificial intelligence, the US and the EU still can construct guardrails ensuring safe use of the breakthrough technology. This paper is based on a careful review of official documents and more than a dozen interviews with officials, analysts, and business representatives in both Brussels and Washington. The interviews were conducted on Chatham House background rules, to allow for honest discussion. By bringing together the Brussels-based Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies and the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis, our goal was to understand, synthesize, encourage, and improve this promising joint endeavor.",

Many people, for various reasons, dared to challenge the strongest and most brutal dictatorship in Europe: a dictatorship that had been building a system of oppression for 25 years. In any case, their reasons related to natural rights and recognised human rights: the right to participate in the governance of one’s state, the right to have no torture or disproportionate use of force, the right to peaceful assembly, the right to a fair trial, etc. Therefore, it is clear that Belarusians, who had a choice — either to go behind bars or to flee from injustice — chose to move to a country where respect for human rights was not only declared, but also enforced. Among the EU countries, the closest neighbours of Belarus — Lithuania and Poland — turned out to be the most popular among migrants. Lithuanians and Poles represented by their own governments demonstrated good-neighbourly behaviour: by letting hundreds of thousands of Belarusians in, they did enough to ease the situation of those who lost their homes through no fault of their own. The governments of these countries were guided by international norms implemented in their national legal systems, such as the norms of refugee treatment and anti-discrimination. However, Belarusians in Poland and Lithuania face discrimination on the grounds of their origin from time to time. This report describes how serious and systematic these facts are, in what domains they are manifested, and most importantly, why discrimination happens and how it can be fought.

Yet barely two years after what Brexiteers celebrated as ‘Independence Day’, the bold promises made by the ‘Leave’ side in the referendum campaign have not—or have not yet—materialised. The national mood now, as evidenced in public opinion surveys, is increasingly unconvinced that Brexit is the answer to the UK’s current problems or impending challenges. The paper examines how the Brexit that was promised was always unrealisable because it naively overlooked the marked asymmetry of power between the EU27 and its former member state. The issues raised by the UK government’s preferred ‘hard Brexit’ were bound to face serious challenges that could not be wished away by simplistic ‘cherry-picking’ solutions. During the withdrawal negotiations the three British prime ministers (in just five years) preferred hubris to pragmatism and fantasy over fact, with the eventual outcome being one that was far removed from what was promised in the referendum. Indeed, Brexit has brought the UK serious challenges and unanticipated consequences, both domestically and in terms of its external policy. These were harsh lessons that successive British governments needed to face and that they avoided by defying the realities of hard power. The latest incumbent in Downing Street has finally begun to confront these unpalatable truths, acknowledging momentous challenges in the near and far abroad that point to the need to reset UK–EU relations. The time is not quite right for this though, as Brexit was a seismic, even a traumatic event for both sides. For that very reason the recent improvement in relations by no means ensures a prompt return to thestatus quo ante. It does however point to a more constructive relationship. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?

The Russian narrative, as espoused by President Vladimir Putin, seeks to depict Ukrainians, Russians and Belarusians as one people—‘the largest state in Europe’—whose origin can be traced to Ancient Rus, with Kyiv as the ‘mother of all Russian cities’. Ukraine’s narrative, on the other hand, has been one of gradually trying to distance itself from the Russian domain. In an attempt to reshape public discourse and perception, the country has been implementing laws promoting ‘de-Stalinisation’ and ‘de-Communisation’. While issues of a political, economic and defensive nature remain fundamental, these debates point to the ever-growing presence of issues concerning history, culture and identity. As the war in Ukraine shows, engaging with such debates need not be considered a death knell for the EU, but an opportunity to forge a more realistic and rounded Union. Thus, this paper recommends that the EU continues to recognise that historical debates can lie at the base of contemporary crises. Furthermore, it argues that the EU needs to show coherence, that it can exploit its soft-power potential better, that greater civic consciousness should be encouraged and that the complementarity between the nation and Europe should be emphasised.

https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/finland-in-the-european-union-what-next/,Finland in the European Union– What next?,12 December 2023,,"EU membership was the most significant foreign and security policy decision in Finland’s history, facilitating NATO accession and seating Finland at the table with major Western powers. Current and future governments ought to recognise the significance of European integration and present a more tangible political vision for the future of the EU. The world system is changing, and the EU needs to adapt externally but also internally. In the debate on possible reforms, Finland should not shy away from integration but needs to also look after its interests. Due to the war in Ukraine, the questions related to the American commitment to Europe’s security as was the case previously, and global developments in security and defence will play a stronger role. Finland has joined NATO, which gives it new perspectives, possibilities, and responsibilities. While NATO will be a major platform for security and defence cooperation, the EU will have increasing importance. Finland, as a country on Russia’s border, has a crucial role in leading that debate and is also a driver of EU defence cooperation within the NATO framework. Security in all its dimensions will play a more important role in the future, and not least due to the cloud that US domestic politics are casting over transatlantic defence cooperation, there is a strong interest to develop the EU as a security provider. As the articles in this publication point out, Finland’s border with Russia is not only a border of two states but a border of two global systems and views which are challenging one another. As a result, increasingly, what comes next for the European Union is no longer for Finland to find out but for Finland to define. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?",

It can be accessed for free by clickinghere. The Russian state is a threat to freedom in Europe and the integrity of the EU. Since 1945 we have relied on the United States to protect freedom on our continent. While it is to be hoped the US will be able to stay involved in the most successful democratic alliance in history, the risk of conflict in Asia, a return to isolationism, or the re-election of Donald Trump is too high for the EU not to develop a defence industrial and technological base (DITB) able to supply Europe’s defence on its own. Such a renewed DITB will furthermore be able to contribute to the collective defence of democracy across the globe and support our friends and allies in the United States and democratic Asia. In the worst case it will allow Europe to defend itself from Russian aggression alone. In the best circumstances it will strengthen the international community of democracies. This paper finds that developing such capability is well within the capacity of the EU and its member states and proposes a series of measures by which it can be financed. It analyses the composition of the defence budgets of EDA members between 2017 and 2021, and assesses their levels of defence investment, research and development, and “research and technology” (R&T – fundamental technological research that is itself an input to R&D). It identifies gaps and recommends EU policies and instruments to close them. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT? Download the publication",

Beyond the confines of larger urban centres lies a rich tapestry of towns, villages and open countryside. These are the places whose traditions and resilience have helped define Europe’s way of life for centuries. They are Europe’s heartlands. The EU’s rural and exurban areas account for over 80% of its total area and are home to over 30% of its population. Yet across Europe these communities feel disconnected. They feel detached from an increasingly remote political process—one which, they believe, gives precedence to the priorities of urban decision-makers rather than to the needs of smaller, less vocal communities. In many sectors, particularly in agriculture, people believe that their way of life is threatened by an unending deluge of European and national level regulations. Many feel abandoned by traditional political parties and disorientated by the rapid pace of economic and social change. Europe needs a new approach to rural development because not every town needs to become a technology hub, nor every village a tourist hotspot. Our Contract with Rural Europe provides a Five-Point Plan for Europe’s Heartlands. First, the Green Deal must become a positive partnership for farmers. Second, rural citizens are equal citizens requiring the same connectivity and skills as those living in urban areas. Third, essential rural communities require essential public services. Fourth, youth and quality of life will drive lasting growth. Fifth, the EU needs to get back to basics and start focusing on meeting the day-to-day needs of its rural citizens. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?

Outdated communication, undemocratic decision-making processes, lack of compelling ideologies, susceptibility to corruption are all criticisms directed towards political parties to explain why they are a relic of the past. But, perhaps surprisingly to some, political parties haven’t disappeared. They have remained the core political acteurs in all Western-style democracies. Much acclaimed alternatives such as “movements” or other forms of “direct democracy” had not been able to substitute those old-fashioned institutions from the 19th century. How have political parties across Europe reacted to a rapidly changing environment? Are there lessons from different European countries worthy of being adopted by others? How can the legitimacy of Western democratic systems be strengthened, and what specific contribution can political parties make to this? And last but not least, what is the particular role of European political parties as a relatively new type of political actor? To find answers to these and many other questions, the International Republican Institute (IRI) has set up an ambitious project for a comparative analysis of selected national party systems across Europe, which the Wilfred Martens Centre for European Studies is pleased to publish. Leading experts from political science, think tanks and parties had been invited to provide a comprehensive insight into the diverse landscape of political parties on the continent.

In the long run, and to be credible, the EU needs to go beyond rhetoric, develop resilient sustainable partnerships, and implement concrete projects, while considering the needs and priorities of its partners, in this case Latin American and Caribbean countries. At the same time, in a new geopolitical era, the EU also must find its position on the global stage and build its “geopolitical identity”.

https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/the-power-of-opacity-eu-responses-to-weaponised-migration/,The Power of Opacity: EU Responses to Weaponised Migration,25 October 2023,,"Orchestrating migration pressure has long been an instrument used by a variety of actors to create leverage, extract concessions, inflict damage on reputations or pursue other hostile intentions. The EU has faced several such attempts. The events organised by the Lukashenka regime in Belarus in 2021, by Türkiye in early 2020 and by Morocco in May 2021 are the most notable. This policy brief argues that the EU has handled recent situations of migration coercion rather well and has the potential to handle them even better in the future. The apparent inconsistency and fluidity of EU action is often subject to criticism in the media, a cause of exasperation for national and EU officials, and perceived as a serious deficiency to be remedied. However, the same policy and operational opacity has significant advantages: it makes the EU an unpredictable target for migration instrumentalisation, presenting adversaries with planning challenges. Commenting on existing Commission proposals, the paper argues the continued unpredictability of EU responses, albeit based on an imperfect legislative status quo, is preferable to EU laws that might constrain the bloc’s room for manoeuvre.

Since the Thessaloniki Summit of 2003, only Croatia managed to join the EU, while the other countries in the region remain candidates for membership, with little prospects to join by 2030. The research investigates how China’s approach impacts specific outcomes, both supporting and undermining the EU accession process, chapter by chapter. It also explores the reasons behind these outcomes, including China’s approach, domestic agency, and geopolitical factors. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and cross-country analysis of China’s impact in the region and identify areas where the Western Balkan countries can eliminate or minimise negative consequences, or leverage potential synergies, ultimately aiming to understand the interplay between China’s involvement and the EU integration process in the Western Balkans.

It is based on an extensive online survey carried out in all 27 EU member states. It reveals an acute economic insecurity and fear of falling behind among EU citizens, especially in the lower social strata. It also shows that this crisis of citizens’ expectations and prospects is a threat to political stability, as it feeds into a dangerous crisis of legitimacy and trust in public institutions and political parties. Concerns may be most strongly expressed in the economic field, but also extend to the possible consequences of the war in Ukraine and the broader geopolitical realignments it entails. In particular, the combination of middle-class insecurity and relatively high levels of trust in Russia in parts of Southern and Eastern Europe should be highlighted. However, citizens also think that most challenges can be tackled and reversed through adequate political and policy action. In particular, the centre–right’s approaches to security, immigration and the economy retain great appeal among the European middle classes; there is a need to better connect with the lower middle classes though. Citizens also have a high estimation of the problem-solving capacity of civil-society actors and a relatively high level of trust in the EU. An inclusive narrative addressing European challenges on the basis of safety, stability, justice, freedom and cooperation could help to reassure Europe’s middle classes. Centre–right forces have a fundamental role to play in this process. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT? Download the publication See the publication in a flipbook",

https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/why-price-stability-matters/,Why Price Stability Matters,27 July 2023,,"As of March 2023, overall inflation is declining in Europe. However, core inflation levels continue to remain well above the 2% mandate of the European Central Bank (ECB). In fact, the current bout of inflation should continue to weaken as and when supply-chain disruption and energy shortages abate. If prices should decline somewhat from their recent peak levels, their contribution to inflation would even be negative, that is, they would contribute to lower inflation rates. However, there are also factors that will prevent a large and immediate decline in inflation as soon as these scarcities wane. As import and supply prices have risen very strongly in recent months, it will take some time for these price increases to feed through the value chains into the final consumption and consumer prices. This is an important reason why inflation will remain significantly higher than 2% for the next one to two years. However, after this period inflation should come down again to more normal levels, unless significant new price pressures or ‘second-round effects’ occur. An important second-round effect would be a rise in inflation expectations among economic actors. This is why the ECB needs to continue to signal its commitment to getting inflation down to its target rate of 2% in the medium term. Another important second-round effect—one that is closely connected to inflation expectations—is the potential for a wage–price spiral. In fact, this represents the largest current danger as it could lead to high inflation becoming much more persistent. Import price increases (and particularly energy price shocks) must not be amplified by further labour cost shocks, but instead the resulting loss of purchasing power must be shared between employees (through lower real wages) and employers (through lower profits, as firms cannot usually fully pass on higher input costs in their sales prices). If trade unions force significant labour cost increases to keep real wages constant or even rising, renewed cost shocks would lead to new price pressures for firms and force them to increase their sales prices further. This would most likely lead to a wage–price spiral and would force the ECB to raise interest rates even more, thus increasing the costs of disinflation and the danger of a recession. To prevent a wage–price spiral, it is thus high time for macroeconomic coordination between the vari­ous policy actors. Monetary policy should focus on targeting price stability, while wage bargaining and fiscal policy should support monetary policy in this objective. Wage negotiation outcomes should include one-off payments by companies on top of normal wage increases. One-off payments would target purchas­ing power losses but would, at the same time, prevent a long-term increase in labour costs. Fiscal policy should make one-off payments attractive for companies and employees by allowing generous tax deduc­tion possibilities. Even more important, fiscal policy should strive to limit the impact of the current large price increases by providing targeted income support for those members of society most negatively affected by higher inflation rates. In any case, due to high inflation rates and actual supply-side constraints, it is cur­rently not the time for a fiscal stimulus via higher government expenditures.",
https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/from-bad-to-worse-the-continuing-effects-of-sanctions-on-russia/,From Bad to Worse: The Continuing Effects of Sanctions on Russia,23 June 2023,,"This paper is a follow-up to the comprehensive report “Beyond the Headlines: The Real Impact of Western Sanctions on Russia”, which was published by the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies in November 2022. Back then, the paper argued that the widespread view of Russia “weathering” the sanctions, which supposedly brought only a “limited” impact, was wrong, and actually based on an erroneous focus on just a handful of manipulated or misleading macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP, the ruble exchange rate, unemployment, and inflation. A broader cross-sectoral look and focus on a wider set of indicators more realistically reflecting the contraction of economic activity showed a totally different picture: that the sanctions in fact were having a much wider, systemic, and lasting economic impact, which would only continue to increase over time. This meant that sanctions were working, and strategic patience was needed to see their full, devastating impact on the Russian economy. And all this was before the EU embargo on Russian oil came into effect, cutting Russia off yet another significant part of its energy export revenues. Since then, the situation has gotten much worse for Putin and the Russian economy. First and foremost, the EU oil embargo – on the backdrop of intensified Russian military spending – has thrown Russia into a full-blown budget crisis, something which the country was able to escape in 2022. The 2022 fiscal year ended with a significant deficit (2,3% of GDP) after being in surplus for 11 months; in the first four months of 2023, the budget deficit has exceeded the planned annual deficit (envisaged by the federal budget law) by 17%. It is important to note that, with a significant drop in private and foreign investment, the economy has increased its reliance on state assistance – the weakness of governmental finances, therefore, is a major impediment to any recovery.

https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/european-sovereignty-between-autonomy-and-dependence-a-guide-for-eu-policy/,European sovereignty between autonomy and dependence: A guide for EU policy,22 June 2023,,"Is the idea of ‘European sovereignty’ still relevant? It was originally developed as an EU response to the rise of populism within its territory and the disruption of transatlantic relations brought about by the Trump presidency. But today its relevance appears uncertain in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the growing assertiveness of China. This brief argues that European sovereignty (and related concepts such as strategic autonomy) is still an important and necessary guide for EU policy, but only if it is dissociated from some of the excessive and overambitious definitions given to the concept when it was first developed. European sovereignty is bound to fail if it is defined as taking an equidistant position between the US and China or as aiming for the atavistic goal of autarky in all conceivable policy areas, from security and energy to economy and technology. Instead, the brief argues, European sovereignty must be understood as a moderate and pragmatic agenda of defending EU interests and priorities within the wider framework of the transatlantic relationship, protecting the EU’s internal liberal political and economic order, and defending international openness where the EU still has comparative advantages. Most of all, the necessary objective of protecting European sovereignty against external forces must not become a backdoor for the undue centralisation of political and economic power inside the EU, a process that would be bound to generate new populist reactions and constrain the EU’s room of manoeuvre internationally. The brief concludes by proposing an understanding of European sovereignty as a compound term, containing both the ideal of EU autonomy of action internationally and the protection of the Union’s internal heterogeneity, diversity and level playing field. Understood in this way as a ‘sovereignty of sovereignties’, European sovereignty can serve as an important guide for EU policy. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?

But the SDGs were not the first global target agreements of the United Nations. They were preceded by the “Millennium Development Goals” (MDGs), which set eight goals concentrated on combating poverty in the world, especially in developing countries. Its successor, the 17 SDGs, have a much broader reach in terms of goals and scope, and included highly developed countries and the EU as well. These developed societies face the same need as developing countries for a major transitionary and transformative change towards sustainable growth that protects the environment, helps communities and their inhabitants adapt to a changing climate, and which is more inclusive regarding social and resource-conserving goals. This paper shows that the European economic model of a Social Market Economy offers a good starting point for successfully mastering the structural change towards a more resource-efficient production. The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), representing the voice of social partners and civil society in the concert of the EU institutions, contributes to the three pillars of sustainability – economic growth, social equity and ecological sustainability – reinforcing each other by balancing the right regulatory and institutional framework for transition.

https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/reforming-economic-and-monetary-union-balancing-spending-and-public-debt-sustainability/,Reforming Economic and Monetary Union: Balancing Spending and Public Debt Sustainability,05 June 2023,,"Fiscal policy in the EU faces the dilemma of having to meet large spending needs despite the existence of elevated public debt ratios. Fiscal policy therefore needs to put the member states on a sustainable path to gradual debt reduction. The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is the decisive mechanism in the EU to ensure that this is the case. The European Commission’s proposal to reform the SGP is, in theory, a step in the right direction. However, it has some major practical shortcomings: among others, it permits a long adjustment period and grants considerable political discretion to the European Commission. To seize the theoretical opportunities the reform offers, the proposal needs to be depoliticised. To this end, independent institutions should have a more important role. Moreover, common quantitative benchmarks should be introduced as safeguards to limit the political discretion allowed. With a basic public debt sustainability analysis, we find that even in the baseline scenario the public debt ratio is likely to increase in some big member states such as France. In our two more pessimistic scenarios most member states analysed would see their public indebtedness rise, with the notable exceptions of Greece and Portugal. In such a situation, a sovereign debt crisis could arise. In this case there would not be sufficient capacity to meet the transformative spending required in the years ahead. A sound reform of the SGP is therefore a vital building block when considering how to square the circle of high public expenditure needs with the existing high public debt ratios.

On the face of it, Beijing presents itself as an exemplar of the clean energy transition and a responsible global actor breaking its long-standing fossil-fuel addictions. China’s stellar roll-out of renewable infrastructure and its recent international pledges on decarbonisation lend support to such a narrative. However, the reality is different. The Asian country remains the world’s largest energy consumer with an incredibly energy-intensive industrial sector. More than 80% of its energy mix comes from fossil fuels, and the country is the major producer and consumer of coal globally. China is the world’s biggest polluter and its carbon footprint is only set to increase. Worse still, China’s reliance on coal remains a consciously built-in feature of its future energy policy. This policy brief has three main objectives. First, it analyses China’s current energy mix and the likely future trends for both its fossil and clean energy sectors. A special focus is placed on China’s growing reliance on coal, as well as on the direction of the country’s oil and gas imports, both of which have serious repercussions for global markets and the Sino-Russian relationship. China’s clean energy sector is then analysed and put into perspective. Second, the brief explores the unique characteristics of Chinese energy policy and the goal of energy security as its guiding principle. China’s economic and energy outlook is not just a product of technocratic deliberations but follows the dictum of the Chinese Communist Party, which remains the nucleus of the country’s political life. Finally, the paper closes with an overview of the most important considerations for EU policymakers and puts forward a number of policy recommendations. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?

https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/the-war-in-ukraine-and-the-way-forward/,The War in Ukraine and the Way Forward,28 March 2023,,"On 24 February 2022, conventional interstate conflict returned to Europe after Russia launched an unprovoked war against Ukraine. Although some predicted at the time that Kyiv would fall in a matter of days, the Ukrainian people continue to fight to defend their homeland and push Russia out. Their bravery and determination should be saluted, and the international community should continue to show solidarity towards Ukraine. Russia’s invasion is a major breach of international law, specifically the principle that the borders of recognised states should not be changed by the force of arms. Ukrainians voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and the USSR’s successor state, the Russian Federation, recognised Ukrainian independence in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Allowing Russia’s aggression to stand would weaken this principle and provide a precedent for other aggressive states to extend their frontiers by force. It is unclear how much longer the war will last. Russia has remained committed to waging war against Ukraine, and Ukraine has ruled out any peace that does not involve the return of all its occupied provinces, including the province of Crimea. Furthermore, the land that Ukraine is seeking to free from Russian occupation is perceived by both sides as part of their national identity, but it remains Ukrainian under international law. This means that the chances for a sustainable peace deal are currently rather slim. The EU must therefore prepare for a protracted Russo-Ukrainian war, characterised by intermittent periods of escalation and de-escalation. To deal with such a conflict, the EU needs an action plan. The objectives of this action plan should be to (1) push Russia to cease all hostilities towards Ukraine and withdraw its forces as a first step beyond the 24 February 2022 borders, (2) assist Ukraine in recovering and rebuilding itself, (3) facilitate Ukraine’s accession to the EU, and (4) enhance the EU’s strategic sovereignty, i.e., its capacity to react and deal with external shocks. To reach these goals, a set of short, medium, and long-term options are presented below. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?",

This short piece presents a historical comparison of the Ukraine post-invasion migration with other similar situations in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The comparison reveals that with more than 6 million crossings in both directions, the cross-border movements in the first 2 months of the Russian assault on Ukraine constitute probably the most intensive conflict-induced migration on record at the global scale during a two-months period. By 24 February 2023, some 8.1 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded across Europe (including non-EU countries). Surprisingly, the EU, which has welcomed the majority of the refugees following the Russian attack, has been able to absorb such large numbers without the inflow causing a major political conflict between the member states. The European societies’ sympathy for the plight of the fleeing Ukrainians has played a decisive role in this. The Ukrainian displacement shows that each immigration flow is unique and that there are instances where mass immigration does not shake the EU to the core. The unexpectedness of this influx also serves as a reminder that the EU needs to develop robust plans for migration contingencies. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?

Unfortunately, it’s now viewed as a panicked reaction to the Biden administrations Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in the United States. While the American legislation will increase the attractiveness of the US as a “green” investment location – a move which is positive for global efforts to combat climate change – it will not automatically result in a flight of capital and employment across the Atlantic. Rather, there is a real possibility that the hurried implementation of Brussels’ current proposals may, unintentionally, undermine the European Single Market, increase friction between member states and ultimately weaken the Transatlantic economic relationship. Politically, the Industrial Strategy proposals cannot be considered in isolation. They are closely linked to a whole array of interlinked proposals regarding Trade Policy, State Aid Rules, the Competitiveness Agenda and Education to name but a few. They also form part of a significantly wider debate about the future direction of the EU itself. In this context, increased protectionism, supporting national champions and more EU-level borrowing represents a more statist, more centralised vision of European integration. A vision which challenges the Single Market underpinnings which have formed the basis of Europe’s decades-long economic expansion. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT? Download the publication",
https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/artificial-intelligence-and-democracy/,Artificial Intelligence and Democracy,01 February 2023,,"Politics is, first and foremost, concerned with shaping the future. In the years to come, politicians will have to increasingly rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to support them in their efforts; especially when it is necessary to make well-informed decisions. The online symposium on “Artificial Intelligence and Democracy”, which was organised by the Political Academy in cooperation with the Wilfried Martens Centre for European Studies and transmitted in February 2022, examined what is important in political work with AI-supported decision-making tools, and what AI means for democracy. Numerous national and international experts reflected on and explained “artificial intelligence” from various perspectives. We have summarised the contributions to this online symposium for you in this overview. The text is available in English and German. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT? Download the publication",
https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/relations-between-the-eu-and-switzerland-too-much-to-lose-too-little-to-negotiate/,"Relations Between the EU and Switzerland: Too Much to Lose, Too Little to Negotiate?",26 January 2023,,"As the saying goes, for all the time of its peaceful existence, Switzerland has only produced the cuckoo clock. This is not correct, of course, both because the cuckoo clock was invented in Bavaria, and, more importantly, because Switzerland has contributed significantly to Europe’s political development. The country is not only the earliest and brightest example of republican and federal governance, but its legal and political ties with the EU have also created the entangled concept of bilateralism. This dynamic relationship has worked well for many years, so it may come as a surprise to discover how fragile it is, especially at a time when every deal must be sealed not only between reasonable counterparts but also with the approval of the respective electorates. This paper examines how diplomatic dialogue between the EU and Switzerland has evolved since the beginning of the 1990s. Even though traditionally predictable and moderate, both partners have recently encountered difficulties in achieving a comprehensive trade and legal relationship. This would not have been an issue if the existing framework was still reliable, which is currently not the case. Over the past year and a half there has been increasing confusion as to why the EU and Switzerland cannot find agreement, as well as a demonstration of the adverse consequences of damaged trust. By explaining the context and the possible causes of the political stalemate, several takeaways are suggested as ways to resolve it successfully. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?

https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/up-up-and-away-a-price-stability-guide-for-policymakers/,"Up, Up and Away? A Price Stability Guide for Policymakers",10 January 2023,,"Inflation is back with surprising force. Should inflation remain significantly elevated over an extended period, detrimental effects on the EU’s economic model, on growth and on social peace can be expected. A coordinated macroeconomic response is required, combining monetary and fiscal policy. The European Central Bank needs to continue to signal its willingness to stick to its price stability mandate to keep inflation expectations under control. It should not succumb to the goal of fiscal dominance by targeting public debt sustainability more than price stability. This would imply giving up its independence. Fiscal policy should facilitate the objective of monetary policy to target inflation while minimising the impact on economic growth. To reduce the danger of a wage–price spiral, fiscal policy should strive to limit the impact of extreme price rises and should be targeted towards those members of society most affected by the higher prices. In contrast, general expenditure increases or tax reductions for an extended period of time carry the danger of overburdening governments. Price interventions should be the very last option, as they decrease the incentive to reduce the demand for higher priced goods and thus do not allow for the signalling power of prices regarding scarcity. Due to high inflation rates and supply-side constraints, it is currently not the right time for a fiscal demand stimulus. ENJOYING THIS CONTENT?
